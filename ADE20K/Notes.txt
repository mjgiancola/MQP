- Three reasons why there was variance (in paper)
	- We could remove this variance

Three labelers, first had a lot of experience with image segmentation, two had experience with image labeling. First labeled twice with six months apart

- image we used was originally from LabelMe dataset

- loadAde20K uses imread to read in images
	- should be able to use imwrite to write back results of model
	- going to want to customize model to spit out into a nice form for matlab to read

make sure to cite ade20k and labelme
